# Project Overview

Multiple Jupyter notebooks focused on data preparation, evaluation, and fine-tuning of models. 

## Files:

- **finetuning_base_1.ipynb**: Implements the base finetuning processes to enhance the model's accuracy.

- **tuning_base_2.ipynb**: Continuation of base tuning procedures to further refine model performance.

- **Data_preparation_tuning_3.ipynb**: Handles the initial data preparation and tuning steps to optimize the dataset for model training.

- **Training_with_params_4.ipynb**: Configures model training with specific parameters for better results.

- **Evaluation_05.ipynb**: Evaluates the performance of the model, including metrics and validation against test data.
